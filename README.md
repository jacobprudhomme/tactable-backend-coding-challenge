# Tactable Backend Coding Challenge

Hello Tactable! First, install the necessary packages with `npm install`. To compile, run `npm run build`. To run a little example that shows that the todo-fetching functionality works as it should, run `npm start`. To make sure all tests (the unit and integration tests that were mentioned in the task description) pass, run `npm test`.

Note: I used Node.js v16.13 to build this, though all the language features I used should work with versions of Node.js 7.6+.
