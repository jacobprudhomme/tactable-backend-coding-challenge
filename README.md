# Tactable Backend Coding Challenge

Hello Tactable! To compile, run `npm run build`. To run an example that fetches all the todos in order to show that the functionality works as it should, run `npm run start`. To make sure all tests (the unit and integration tests that were mentioned in the task description) pass, run `npm test`.
